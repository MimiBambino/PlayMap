Instructions
================

Enter a location in the search bar at the bottom of the screen (or turn on location services for auto-detect)

Filter search results by typing a query in the search bar in the upper right hand corner

The list will contain 10 dinosaur fossils that were found nearest to your location.

Clicking on a marker or list item centers the map on the item and gives an info window with data about the kind of dinosaur fossil and any YouTube videos on that kind of dinosaur.
