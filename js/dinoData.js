Qantassaurus was named after the national airline of Australia, Qantas; oddly enough, another Australian ornithopod, Atlascopcosaurus, was named after the Atlas-Copco Company."

		"description": "The largest sauropod ever to be discovered in Australia, Rhoetosaurus is especially important because it dates from the middle, rather than the late, Jurassic period (and thus appeared on the scene much earlier than two Australian titanosaurs, Diamintinasaurus and Wintonotitan). As far as paleontologists can tell, Rhoetosaurus closest non-Australian relative was the Asian Shunosaurus."
